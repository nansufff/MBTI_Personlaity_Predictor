# MBTI_Personlaity_Predictor
In todayâ€™s digital world, our words say more than we thinkâ€”especially on platforms like Twitter. For this project, we explored how personality traits can be inferred from language patterns using the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) framework.

ðŸ§© What the Personality Predictor does:

 â€¢ Collects a userâ€™s 50 most recent tweets using Tweepy 
 
 â€¢ Performs advanced text preprocessing and cleaning
 
 â€¢ Extracts semantic and linguistic features using TF-IDF and word embeddings
 
 â€¢ Feeds the features into an XGBoost classification model to predict one of the 16 MBTI personality types
 
 â€¢ Trained and evaluated using MBTI-labelled datasets and live Twitter data for validation
 
This project was a deep dive into the intersection of psychology and machine learning.
